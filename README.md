# Ski Jumping World Cup
This is one of my first applications. While I was creating it I was learning the basics of programming and building websites.<br />
This app calculates the total number of points scored by a ski jumper based on the k-point of the hill, distance, style notes, gate points and wind points. In addition, the ranking of all jumpers is also displayed.<br />
